# ESP32 IoT Application

# 📟 EmbeddedProject
Smart Plant Monitor is an IoT project based on ESP32 chip. In this demonstration, the application have to monitor plant life status and generate an alarm where specif conditions are met. ESP32 acquires ambient teperature, sand humidity and solar radiation data, process them and provide information via bluetooth and using OLED display.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Read sand humidity sensor using adc peripheral.
- ✅ Read ambient temperature using I2C protocol.
- ✅ Detect solar radiation using digital peripheral.
- ✅ Turn On/Off diode Led based on algorithm and using digital peripheral.
- ✅ Show data on OLED display by I2C protocol.
- ✅ Provide data via Bluetooth.
